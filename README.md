age_quiz
In this code we take the user's age and store it in a variable called 'age' .
We assumed that the oldest person would be 100 years old, and if the user enters a higher number than 100 years we print, "Sorry, you are dead. "  
If the user's age is 40 or over we output/print "Your over the hill."
If the user's age is 60 or older we output the message "Enjoy your retirement!", and if he/she is under 13, we print "You qualify for the kiddie discount."
When the user is 21 years old we output the message "Congrats on your 21st" and for any other age we output the message "Age is but a number."
